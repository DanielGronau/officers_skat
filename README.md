# Officer's Skat

This is just a project to get used to Godot. Officier's Skat is a simplified two-player version of Germany's national card game Skat.

The game is well-suited for local play, as both players see the same cards - all playable cards are visible.

If possible, I'll include an AI, but I wouldn't bet on its strength.

I won't implement multiplayer via network, that would be overkill (and then a web-implementation would make more sense than a desktop app)

# Done

# To do

- implement human vs human game play
- mark playable cards / gray out unplayable cards
